# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository.
This is the Readme file within my first GitHub repository.
I can add to this Readme file as time goes on in an effort to keep users apprised of the basic nature of this repository.
The Readme file can get very long if I continue making additions without regard to the length of the introductory file on the repository.
On the other hand, I'll want to be careful not to include extraneous information just for the sake of writing nonsense.  My users may not appreciate the subtle humor involved in writing complete gibberish for publication to the entire world wide web framework across the globe.  It will be better if I return to this file later and parse out some of the extra language so that readers don't spend too much time and energy reading nonsense that has no bearing on the actual project itself but simply steals time away which can never be regained.
